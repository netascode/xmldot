Crash: Set operation with malformed XML
Input: xml="<root>" path="root.item" value="value"
Error: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [:-1]
Test: FuzzSet/seed#8, FuzzSetMalformed/seed#0
Severity: High - Panic in Set operation

This crash occurs when Set() is called on malformed XML (unclosed root tag).
The builder code has a slice bounds error when trying to manipulate the malformed structure.

Expected behavior: Set should either:
1. Return an error for malformed XML
2. Handle malformed input gracefully without panic

Fix required in: builder.go (Set implementation)

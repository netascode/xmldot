Bug: Attribute results return incorrect type
Input: Multiple attribute access patterns (e.g., "<root a='b'/>" with path "root.@a")
Expected: result.Type should be String (type constant for string values)
Actual: result.Type is 6

Severity: Medium - Type inconsistency but doesn't cause crashes

This indicates an issue with Result type constants or attribute result creation.
Need to check:
1. Result type constants definition
2. Attribute result creation in Get operation
3. Type assignment for attribute values

Fix required in: result.go or get.go (attribute result creation)
